We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
So breaking free
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
Creating space between us
'Till we're separate hearts
But your faith it gives me strength
Strength to believe
We're breakin' free
We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah we're breaking free
Oh, we're breakin' free
Ohhhh
Can you feel it building
Like a wave the ocean just can't control
Connected by a feeling
Ohhh, in our very souls
Very souls
Ooooh
Rising 'till it lifts us up
So every one can see
We're breakin' free
We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah we're breaking free
Ohhh, breaking free
Ooohâ€¦
