## This song sucks 

We're soarin', flyin' <br>
There's not a star in heaven <br>
That we can't reach <br>
If we're trying<br>
So breaking free <br>
You know the world can see us <br>
In a way that's different than who we are <br>
Creating space between us <br>
'Till we're separate hearts <br>
But your faith it gives me strength <br>
Strength to believe <br>
We're breakin' free <br>
We're soarin' <br>
Flyin' <br>
There's not a star in heaven <br>
That we can't reach <br>
If we're trying <br>
Yeah we're breaking free<br>
Oh, we're breakin' free <br>
Ohhhh<br>
Can you feel it building<br>
Like a wave the ocean just can't control<br>
Connected by a feeling<br>
Ohhh, in our very souls<br>
Very souls<br>
Ooooh<br>
Rising 'till it lifts us up<br>
So every one can see<br>
We're breakin' free<br>
We're soarin'<br>
Flyin'<br>
There's not a star in heaven<br>
That we can't reach<br>
If we're trying<br>
Yeah we're breaking free<br>
Ohhh, breaking free<br>
Ooohâ€¦<br>
